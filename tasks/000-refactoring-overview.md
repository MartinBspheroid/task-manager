# Process Queue Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This refactoring plan addresses the flawed process queue implementation introduced in commit `babdeea`. While the current implementation adds unnecessary overhead without benefits, we recognize the future need for proper queuing functionality. This plan outlines a systematic approach to implement queuing correctly.

## Goals

1. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Existing code should continue to work without modifications
2. **Add Real Value**: Implement actual concurrency control and rate limiting
3. **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns properly between ProcessTask and queue management
4. **Performance**: Minimize overhead when queuing is not needed
5. **Flexibility**: Support various use cases (rate limiting, priority, resource management)

## Key Problems to Solve

1. **Synchronous vs Asynchronous API**: Current implementation returns synchronously but queues asynchronously
2. **Infinite Concurrency**: Using `concurrency: Infinity` defeats the purpose of queuing
3. **Race Conditions**: Tests are flaky due to non-deterministic task startup
4. **No Configuration**: Queue behavior is hardcoded with no way to configure
5. **Missing Features**: No priority support, no queue management, no pause/resume

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Tasks 001-003)
- Revert broken implementation
- Add proper test synchronization
- Document current behavior

### Phase 2: Design (Tasks 004-006)
- Design queue configuration API
- Create abstraction interfaces
- Plan backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Core Implementation (Tasks 007-010)
- Implement configurable queue
- Add synchronous immediate-start mode
- Create async queue-aware API
- Implement queue management methods

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Tasks 011-014)
- Add priority support
- Implement pause/resume
- Add queue events and monitoring
- Resource-based limits

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Tasks 015-017)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance benchmarks
- Update documentation

## Use Cases

1. **Rate Limiting**: Limit concurrent processes to prevent resource exhaustion
2. **Priority Execution**: High-priority tasks run before low-priority ones
3. **Resource Management**: Queue based on CPU/memory availability
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Complete running tasks before accepting new ones
5. **Batch Processing**: Process tasks in controlled batches

## Success Criteria

- All existing tests pass without modification
- New queue features are opt-in
- Performance overhead is minimal when queuing is disabled
- Clear documentation and examples
- No race conditions or flaky tests
